Core directory

This directory contains core functions for implementing the work presented in "Superiorized algorithm for reconstruction of CT images from sparse-view and limited-angle polyenergetic data" by Humphries, Winn and Faridani (https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03396). The files are divided into three directories:

I) phantoms: Code for generating the FORBILD head phantom, which were included in the paper by Yu et al. (See main ReadMe for citation)

II) projection: Code for generating projection data. Directory includes a readme with details.

III) reconstruction: Code for performing iterative reconstruction. Directory includes a readme with details.
