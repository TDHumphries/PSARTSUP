This directory contains scripts for the numerical experiments presented in "Superiorized polyenergetic reconstruction algorithm 
% for reduction of metal artifacts in CT images" by Humphries & Gibali (http://faculty.uwashington.edu/thumphri/HG17.pdf). The scripts are:

i)   make_metal_test_data: Generates data for the experiments
ii)  metal_test: runs reconstructions for the simple phantom at a variety of different noise levels
